# Arraylist-Problem
You enter in N lines. In each line there are zero or more integers. It will answer a few queries where you need to tell the number located in yth position of xth  line.

Input :
The first line has an integer N. In each of the next N lines there will be an integer D denoting number of integers on that line and then there will be D space-separated integers.
In the next line there will be an integer Q denoting number of queries. Each query will consist of two integers x and y.
Constraints :
1 <=  N <= 20000
0 <=  D <= 50000
1 <=  Q <= 1000
1 <=  X <= N
Each number will fit in a signed integer.
Total number of integers in N lines will not cross 105.

Output:
In each line, output the number located in yth position of xth line. If there is no such position, it just prints "ERROR!"
